# Supply chain analytics with sql

This project involves analyzing a fashion startup's supply chain data using SQL to gain insights into key operational metrics. The analysis focuses on areas such as revenue generation, stock levels, production costs, and transportation methods, all aimed at optimizing business performance. By querying the database, we can assess how well the business is doing in terms of sales, customer demand, and resource allocation.

Revenue analysis is a key focus, with queries that break down total revenue by product type and location. This helps identify which products are most profitable and where sales are strongest, guiding future business strategies. Additionally, we evaluate the impact of production costs and lead times on profitability, offering insights into the efficiency of the supply chain.

Transportation methods, stock levels, and defect rates are also examined to ensure smooth operations. By analyzing transportation routes and the correlation between inspection results and defect rates, we can improve logistics and product quality. This project ultimately provides a comprehensive view of the supply chain's performance, helping to streamline production and maximize revenue.
